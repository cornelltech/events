          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">6:00 - 6:30PM - Drinks &amp; SnacksDiscussion begins at 6:30PM
Cities today are built for the car. Even though there are, in most cases, more pedestrians on urban streets, cars have been allocated a majority of space. While most cities have started to at least partially reverse that hierarchy with the creation of bike lanes and shared streets, we are a long way away from a pedestrians and cyclists first approach to planning. The introduction to CAVs is an opportunity to radically change the way we think of and plan the urban environment, if governments are prepared to regulate the deployment of CAVs in an efficient and sustainable way and planners and urban designers are willing to contribute their part to create streets and public spaces that are for all. This moderated panel – made up of an autonomous technology expert, a policy maker, a researcher, and an urban planner – will discuss how cities will be impacted and the role of architects and designers during this technology evolution.
Join us for an engaging debate with industry experts.

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">In honor of legendary DJ Larry Levan, guests at our fourth annual House Music Edition of First Fridays will jam all night long to house music! Levan was a pioneer of the genre in New York City, best known for his decade-long residency at the popular New York City nightclub Paradise Garage. Levan&#39;s cult followers refer to his hours-long sets as &#34;Saturday Mass&#34;, as he experimented with drum machinesÂ andÂ synthesizers, popularizing an electronic, post-disco sound that launched the house music movement.

Guests are encouraged to sign up for a Schomburg Society membership, and visit the Schomburg Shop while networking and dancing the night away! Our host for the night will be Dhalimu from Dhali&#39;s Closet, who&#39;ll entertain the crowd as our deejays DJ Missy B, Craig Nice, and DJ Frankie Paradise will have you moving your feet in the Langston Hughes Lobby.

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">“In Cryptography We Trust,” the unofficial Bitcoin motto, has stimulated the creation of tens of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. What Bitcoin has done for currency, blockchains promise to do for whole industries.
                This workshop will explore the blockchain vision of supplanting human trust with distributed algorithms. Participants representing a broad cross-section of disciplines (e.g., computer scientists, economists, lawyers, legal scholars, entrepreneurs, and regulators) will discuss the technical, social, and legal aspects of reengineering services and whole institutions around blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts. Presentations will cover challenges ranging from crime to overhyped technologies, and solutions ranging from deployed systems to mere gleams in the eyes of academic researchers.
The workshop is co-organized by IC3 (www.initc3.org)

          <h2 class="max-lines">Art and Journalism, Past and Present | Eugene Richards, Sam Stephenson, Arezoo Moseni | An Art Book Series Event | The New York Public Library</h2>
          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">For fifty years, iconic photographer Eugene Richards has traveled the world making seminal records of racism, poverty, drug addiction, cancer, aging, war, and the erosion of rural America, among others. For twenty years, writer Sam Stephenson (of Jazz Loft Project acclaim) followed the global footsteps of Richards&#39; forebear, W. Eugene Smith, the legendary &#34;Master of the Photographic Essay.&#34; 2017 brings landmark books by these two documentary artists.Â  For Richards, his first career retrospective, the powerful The Run-On of Time; for Stephenson, Gene Smith&#39;s Sink, a stunning, spare narrative from Smith&#39;s trail. In this unique conversation moderated by Arezoo Moseni, Eugene Richards and Sam Stephenson explore the tensions and overlaps of art and journalism, and the relevance and necessity of both to our time more than ever.

In an interview with Philippe Halsman, W. Eugene Smith remarked: &#34;I didn&#39;t write the rule - why should I follow them?&#34; Famously unabashed, Smith is photography&#39;s most celebrated humanist. During his reign as a photo-essayist at Life magazine in the 1940s and 1950s, he established himself as an intimate chronicler of human culture. His photographs of jazz musicians, disasters, doctors, and midwives revolutionized the role that image-making played in journalism, transforming photography for decades to come. In 1997, lured by the intoxicating trail of people that emerged from Smith&#39;s stupefying archive, Sam Stephenson set out to research those who knew him from various angles. In Gene Smith&#39;s Sink: A Wide-Angle View, Stephenson revives Smith&#39;s life and legacy, merging traditional biography with highly untraditional digressions. Traveling across twenty-nine states, Japan, and the Pacific, Stephenson tracks down a lively cast of characters, including the playwright Tennessee Williams, to whom Smith likened himself; the avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage, with whom he once shared a chalet; the artist Mary Frank, who was married to his friend Robert Frank; and Thelonious Monk and Sonny Clark, whom Smith recorded on surreptitious tapes. The result of twenty years of research, Gene Smith&#39;s Sink is an unprecedented look into the photographer&#39;s beguiling legacy and the subjects around him.

The Run-On of Time is the first publication to situate the work of Eugene Richards in the long photographic tradition that merges personal artistic vision with documentary practice. Richards is a documentary photographer known for his powerful, unflinching exploration of contemporary social issues from the early 1970s to the present. This remarkable book is the first comprehensive and critical look at Richards&#39;s lifelong achievements. The Run-On of Time is published in conjunction with Eugene Richards retrospective exhibition of the same title on view at George Eastman Museum in Rochester from June 10 - October 22, 2017 and at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City from December 9, 2017 - April 15, 2018. Reproduced in tritone and color, the extraordinary images in this volume explore complicated and controversial subjects, including racism, poverty, drug addiction, cancer, aging, the effects of war and terrorism, and the erosion of rural America. The authors of the book,Â Lisa Hostetler (photography curator at George Eastman Museum) andÂ  April M. Watson (photography curator at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art) situate Richards&#39;s work in the long photographic tradition that merges personal artistic vision with documentary practice, following in the tradition of W. Eugene Smith and Robert Frank.

Copies of Gene Smith&#39;s SinkÂ (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2017) and The Run-On of Time (Yale University Press, 2017) are available for purchase and signing at the end of the event.

Eugene Richards, photographer, writer, and filmmaker, was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1944. After graduating from Northeastern University with a degree in English, he studied photography with Minor White. In 1968, he joined VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, a government program established as an arm of the so-called War on Poverty.  Following a year and a half in eastern Arkansas, Richards helped found a social service organization and a community newspaper, Many Voices, which reported on black political action as well as the Ku Klux Klan.  Photographs he made during these four years were published in his first monograph, Few Comforts or Surprises: The Arkansas Delta. Upon returning to Dorchester, Richards began to document the changing, racially diverse neighborhood where he was born.  After being invited to join Magnum Photos in 1978, he worked increasingly as a freelance magazine photographer, undertaking assignments on such diverse topics as the American family, drug addiction, emergency medicine, pediatric AIDS, aging and death in America.Â  In 1992, he directed and shot Cocaine True, Cocaine Blue, the first of seven short films he would eventually make.

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">This illustrated lecture provides a wide-ranging look at the connections inside the core group of avant-garde artists in Jazz Age Paris. It offers a fresh examination of both canonic and overlooked writers and artists and their works, by revealing them in conversation with one another. The author&#39;s celebration of the many masterpieces shows how the creative community of postwar Paris supported astounding experiments in content and form that still resonate today.

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">The resurgence of zines - self-published limited-distribution works - is stemming the tide of erasure, disrupting publishing,Â and offering creative spaces for diverse voices withinÂ marginalized communities. Remembering zines like &#34;FIRE!!,&#34; created in 1926 and devoted to the young negro artist, author Steven G. Fullwood will join in conversationÂ with contemporary zine creators Devin N. Morris (3 Dot Zine), Nontsikelelo Mutiti (Nontsi), Kevin Harry (KHzines), and Jermel Moody (maple:koyo) to elaborate on their zine-making practices and impact on publishing and creativity. TheÂ program will also feature a marketplace of zines selected inÂ collaboration with Morris, Moody, and the Schomburg Shop.

FIRE!! contributors included Harlem Renaissance figures Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Aaron Douglas.

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">The use of permissioned blockchains in the public sector has the potential to create a new balance point between two extremes: pure algorithmic governance (e.g., Bitcoin) and pure human governance (e.g., your local city council). This talk will explore if and how blockchain can help bring automation, transparency, and audit-ability to the world’s governing systems and institutions. Does the strategic introduction of blockchain-enabled validation mechanisms and smart contracts offer a means for rescuing public confidence in governing institutions while cutting costs and better ensuring fair outcomes per policy? Behlendorf will discuss these and other questions related to blockchain’s coming impact on how we govern.

Cities today are built for the car. Even though there are, in most cases, more pedestrians on urban streets, cars have been allocated a majority of space. While most cities have started to at least partially reverse that hierarchy with the creation of bike lanes and shared streets, we are a long way away from a pedestrians and cyclists first approach to planning. The introduction to CAVs is an opportunity to radically change the way we think of and plan the urban environment, if governments are prepared to regulate the deployment of CAVs in an efficient and sustainable way and planners and urban designers are willing to contribute their part to create streets and public spaces that are for all. This moderated panel – made up of an autonomous technology expert, a policy maker, a researcher, and an urban planner – will discuss how cities will be impacted and the role of architects and designers during this technology evolution.
Join us for an engaging debate with industry experts.

            <p>In honor of legendary DJ Larry Levan, guests at our fourth annual House Music Edition of First Fridays will jam all night long to house music! Levan was a pioneer of the genre in New York City, best known for his decade-long residency at the popular New York City nightclub Paradise Garage. Levan&#39;s cult followers refer to his hours-long sets as &#34;Saturday Mass&#34;, as he experimented with drum machinesÂ andÂ synthesizers, popularizing an electronic, post-disco sound that launched the house music movement.

Guests are encouraged to sign up for a Schomburg Society membership, and visit the Schomburg Shop while networking and dancing the night away! Our host for the night will be Dhalimu from Dhali&#39;s Closet, who&#39;ll entertain the crowd as our deejays DJ Missy B, Craig Nice, and DJ Frankie Paradise will have you moving your feet in the Langston Hughes Lobby.

18+ to party

21+ to drink

Suggested donations are welcome.

            <p>“In Cryptography We Trust,” the unofficial Bitcoin motto, has stimulated the creation of tens of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. What Bitcoin has done for currency, blockchains promise to do for whole industries.
                This workshop will explore the blockchain vision of supplanting human trust with distributed algorithms. Participants representing a broad cross-section of disciplines (e.g., computer scientists, economists, lawyers, legal scholars, entrepreneurs, and regulators) will discuss the technical, social, and legal aspects of reengineering services and whole institutions around blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts. Presentations will cover challenges ranging from crime to overhyped technologies, and solutions ranging from deployed systems to mere gleams in the eyes of academic researchers.
The workshop is co-organized by IC3 (www.initc3.org)

            <p>For fifty years, iconic photographer Eugene Richards has traveled the world making seminal records of racism, poverty, drug addiction, cancer, aging, war, and the erosion of rural America, among others. For twenty years, writer Sam Stephenson (of Jazz Loft Project acclaim) followed the global footsteps of Richards&#39; forebear, W. Eugene Smith, the legendary &#34;Master of the Photographic Essay.&#34; 2017 brings landmark books by these two documentary artists.Â  For Richards, his first career retrospective, the powerful The Run-On of Time; for Stephenson, Gene Smith&#39;s Sink, a stunning, spare narrative from Smith&#39;s trail. In this unique conversation moderated by Arezoo Moseni, Eugene Richards and Sam Stephenson explore the tensions and overlaps of art and journalism, and the relevance and necessity of both to our time more than ever.

In an interview with Philippe Halsman, W. Eugene Smith remarked: &#34;I didn&#39;t write the rule - why should I follow them?&#34; Famously unabashed, Smith is photography&#39;s most celebrated humanist. During his reign as a photo-essayist at Life magazine in the 1940s and 1950s, he established himself as an intimate chronicler of human culture. His photographs of jazz musicians, disasters, doctors, and midwives revolutionized the role that image-making played in journalism, transforming photography for decades to come. In 1997, lured by the intoxicating trail of people that emerged from Smith&#39;s stupefying archive, Sam Stephenson set out to research those who knew him from various angles. In Gene Smith&#39;s Sink: A Wide-Angle View, Stephenson revives Smith&#39;s life and legacy, merging traditional biography with highly untraditional digressions. Traveling across twenty-nine states, Japan, and the Pacific, Stephenson tracks down a lively cast of characters, including the playwright Tennessee Williams, to whom Smith likened himself; the avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage, with whom he once shared a chalet; the artist Mary Frank, who was married to his friend Robert Frank; and Thelonious Monk and Sonny Clark, whom Smith recorded on surreptitious tapes. The result of twenty years of research, Gene Smith&#39;s Sink is an unprecedented look into the photographer&#39;s beguiling legacy and the subjects around him.

The Run-On of Time is the first publication to situate the work of Eugene Richards in the long photographic tradition that merges personal artistic vision with documentary practice. Richards is a documentary photographer known for his powerful, unflinching exploration of contemporary social issues from the early 1970s to the present. This remarkable book is the first comprehensive and critical look at Richards&#39;s lifelong achievements. The Run-On of Time is published in conjunction with Eugene Richards retrospective exhibition of the same title on view at George Eastman Museum in Rochester from June 10 - October 22, 2017 and at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City from December 9, 2017 - April 15, 2018. Reproduced in tritone and color, the extraordinary images in this volume explore complicated and controversial subjects, including racism, poverty, drug addiction, cancer, aging, the effects of war and terrorism, and the erosion of rural America. The authors of the book,Â Lisa Hostetler (photography curator at George Eastman Museum) andÂ  April M. Watson (photography curator at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art) situate Richards&#39;s work in the long photographic tradition that merges personal artistic vision with documentary practice, following in the tradition of W. Eugene Smith and Robert Frank.

Copies of Gene Smith&#39;s SinkÂ (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2017) and The Run-On of Time (Yale University Press, 2017) are available for purchase and signing at the end of the event.

Eugene Richards, photographer, writer, and filmmaker, was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1944. After graduating from Northeastern University with a degree in English, he studied photography with Minor White. In 1968, he joined VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, a government program established as an arm of the so-called War on Poverty.  Following a year and a half in eastern Arkansas, Richards helped found a social service organization and a community newspaper, Many Voices, which reported on black political action as well as the Ku Klux Klan.  Photographs he made during these four years were published in his first monograph, Few Comforts or Surprises: The Arkansas Delta. Upon returning to Dorchester, Richards began to document the changing, racially diverse neighborhood where he was born.  After being invited to join Magnum Photos in 1978, he worked increasingly as a freelance magazine photographer, undertaking assignments on such diverse topics as the American family, drug addiction, emergency medicine, pediatric AIDS, aging and death in America.Â  In 1992, he directed and shot Cocaine True, Cocaine Blue, the first of seven short films he would eventually make.

            <p>This illustrated lecture provides a wide-ranging look at the connections inside the core group of avant-garde artists in Jazz Age Paris. It offers a fresh examination of both canonic and overlooked writers and artists and their works, by revealing them in conversation with one another. The author&#39;s celebration of the many masterpieces shows how the creative community of postwar Paris supported astounding experiments in content and form that still resonate today.

            <p>The resurgence of zines - self-published limited-distribution works - is stemming the tide of erasure, disrupting publishing,Â and offering creative spaces for diverse voices withinÂ marginalized communities. Remembering zines like &#34;FIRE!!,&#34; created in 1926 and devoted to the young negro artist, author Steven G. Fullwood will join in conversationÂ with contemporary zine creators Devin N. Morris (3 Dot Zine), Nontsikelelo Mutiti (Nontsi), Kevin Harry (KHzines), and Jermel Moody (maple:koyo) to elaborate on their zine-making practices and impact on publishing and creativity. TheÂ program will also feature a marketplace of zines selected inÂ collaboration with Morris, Moody, and the Schomburg Shop.

FIRE!! contributors included Harlem Renaissance figures Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Aaron Douglas.

            <p>The use of permissioned blockchains in the public sector has the potential to create a new balance point between two extremes: pure algorithmic governance (e.g., Bitcoin) and pure human governance (e.g., your local city council). This talk will explore if and how blockchain can help bring automation, transparency, and audit-ability to the world’s governing systems and institutions. Does the strategic introduction of blockchain-enabled validation mechanisms and smart contracts offer a means for rescuing public confidence in governing institutions while cutting costs and better ensuring fair outcomes per policy? Behlendorf will discuss these and other questions related to blockchain’s coming impact on how we govern.
