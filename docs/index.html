          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">The urban mix has become mixed-up as retailers fear extinction at the hands of Amazon, hotels are being redesigned to feel like living rooms ‚Äî or are living rooms courtesy of AirBnB ‚Äî while knowledge workers are setting up shop in coworking spaces, restaurants and public places ‚Äî anywhere but the office. What does it mean for cities when old paradigms such as the office tower, department store, factory, and park fall by the wayside or blur together? What are the opportunities and challenges when pop-ups proliferate because no one can meet the landlords‚Äô asking price? When cafes prove more appealing than cubicles, and parks are more than the sum of their playgrounds?
Moderated by Greg Lindsay, writer, futurist and Urbanist-in-Residence at URBAN-X.

Eric Ho, CEO of Good Goods

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">
Come join the conversation this week with¬†Franklin Foer and Zephyr Teachout about Foer&#39;s new book, World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.

In the early days of the Internet&#39;s rise, many of us believed that it would inevitably democratize power. And indeed, if you were an early adopter, you often gained an outsized advantage. Outsiders and insurgents frequently displaced insiders and incumbents. But now a new kind of power is rapidly concentrating: the power to determine how we connect with each other, how we communicate, and on whose terms.¬†
If there is a silver lining, it is that a wide range of voices are rising to ask hard questions about the power of tech. Here at¬†Civic Hall, we believe that people using technology can work to make the world more just, democratic and equitable.¬†With that mission in mind, we&#39;re kicking off an ongoing series of talks on the topic of Tech and Power.
Copies of¬†World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech¬†will be available for purchase!

Register for¬†all three to receive a discount!¬†

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">Bloomberg, Cornell Tech, and Tech:NYC invite you to join us for the latest installment of the CornellTech@Bloomberg series, featuring Miguel McKelvey, Co-founder and Chief Culture Officer of WeWork.The recent rise of shared workspaces represents a new paradigm in the workplace and the future of work, which favors flexibility, connectivity and collaboration among budding entrepreneurs and multinational corporations alike. An early trailblazer of this global trend, WeWork and its Co-founder and Chief Culture Officer Miguel McKelvey are shaping this shift in the way we work and, ultimately, live. As demand for shared workspaces continues to flourish, WeWork, already one of the world‚Äôs most valuable unicorn startups, continues to grow and expand at an astounding rate.Yet, while the world we live in is becoming increasingly connected through technological advances and collaborative work environments, McKelvey believes people have never been more disconnected. As a result, McKelvey has recently taken on the role of Chief Culture Officer at WeWork, where he has shifted his focus from the architecture and design of the company‚Äôs spaces to strengthening and scaling the company‚Äôs organizational culture in the face of rapid growth and global expansion. For many rapidly growing organizations, such as WeWork, the challenge is how to grow and scale at a rapid rate, while also maintaining the culture, community, and principles on which the company was founded ‚Äì and for which its members and employees seek it out.McKelvey will be joined onstage by Bloomberg‚Äôs own Scarlet Fu to discuss his new role as WeWork‚Äôs Chief Culture Officer, WeWork‚Äôs plans for the future, as well as his entrepreneurial journey.Bloomberg L.P.

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">6:00 - 6:30PM - Drinks &amp; SnacksDiscussion begins at 6:30PM
Cities today are built for the car. Even though there are, in most cases, more pedestrians on urban streets, cars have been allocated a majority of space. While most cities have started to at least partially reverse that hierarchy with the creation of bike lanes and shared streets, we are a long way away from a pedestrians and cyclists first approach to planning. The introduction to CAVs is an opportunity to radically change the way we think of and plan the urban environment, if governments are prepared to regulate the deployment of CAVs in an efficient and sustainable way and planners and urban designers are willing to contribute their part to create streets and public spaces that are for all. This moderated panel ‚Äì made up of an autonomous technology expert, a policy maker, a researcher, and an urban planner ‚Äì will discuss how cities will be impacted and the role of architects and designers during this technology evolution.
Join us for an engaging debate with industry experts.

          <h2 class="max-lines">Art and Journalism, Past and Present | Eugene Richards, Sam Stephenson, Arezoo Moseni | An Art Book Series Event | The New York Public Library</h2>
          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">For fifty years, iconic photographer Eugene Richards has traveled the world making seminal records of racism, poverty, drug addiction, cancer, aging, war, and the erosion of rural America, among others. For twenty years, writer Sam Stephenson (of Jazz Loft Project acclaim) followed the global footsteps of Richards&#39; forebear, W. Eugene Smith, the legendary &#34;Master of the Photographic Essay.&#34; 2017 brings landmark books by these two documentary artists.√Ç¬† For Richards, his first career retrospective, the powerful The Run-On of Time; for Stephenson, Gene Smith&#39;s Sink, a stunning, spare narrative from Smith&#39;s trail. In this unique conversation moderated by Arezoo Moseni, Eugene Richards and Sam Stephenson explore the tensions and overlaps of art and journalism, and the relevance and necessity of both to our time more than ever.

In an interview with Philippe Halsman, W. Eugene Smith remarked: &#34;I didn&#39;t write the rule - why should I follow them?&#34; Famously unabashed, Smith is photography&#39;s most celebrated humanist. During his reign as a photo-essayist at Life magazine in the 1940s and 1950s, he established himself as an intimate chronicler of human culture. His photographs of jazz musicians, disasters, doctors, and midwives revolutionized the role that image-making played in journalism, transforming photography for decades to come. In 1997, lured by the intoxicating trail of people that emerged from Smith&#39;s stupefying archive, Sam Stephenson set out to research those who knew him from various angles. In Gene Smith&#39;s Sink: A Wide-Angle View, Stephenson revives Smith&#39;s life and legacy, merging traditional biography with highly untraditional digressions. Traveling across twenty-nine states, Japan, and the Pacific, Stephenson tracks down a lively cast of characters, including the playwright Tennessee Williams, to whom Smith likened himself; the avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage, with whom he once shared a chalet; the artist Mary Frank, who was married to his friend Robert Frank; and Thelonious Monk and Sonny Clark, whom Smith recorded on surreptitious tapes. The result of twenty years of research, Gene Smith&#39;s Sink is an unprecedented look into the photographer&#39;s beguiling legacy and the subjects around him.

The Run-On of Time is the first publication to situate the work of Eugene Richards in the long photographic tradition that merges personal artistic vision with documentary practice. Richards is a documentary photographer known for his powerful, unflinching exploration of contemporary social issues from the early 1970s to the present. This remarkable book is the first comprehensive and critical look at Richards&#39;s lifelong achievements. The Run-On of Time is published in conjunction with Eugene Richards retrospective exhibition of the same title on view at¬†George Eastman Museum in Rochester from June 10 - October 22, 2017 and at¬†The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City from December 9, 2017 - April 15, 2018. Reproduced in tritone and color, the extraordinary images in this volume explore complicated and controversial subjects, including racism, poverty, drug addiction, cancer, aging, the effects of war and terrorism, and the erosion of rural America. The authors of the book,√Ç¬†Lisa Hostetler (photography curator at George Eastman Museum) and√Ç¬† April M. Watson (photography curator at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art) situate Richards&#39;s work in the long photographic tradition that merges personal artistic vision with documentary practice, following in the tradition of W. Eugene Smith and Robert Frank.

Copies of Gene Smith&#39;s Sink√Ç¬†(Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2017) and The Run-On of Time (Yale University Press, 2017) are available for purchase and signing at the end of the event.

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">The resurgence of zines - self-published limited-distribution¬†works - is stemming the tide of erasure, disrupting publishing,√Ç¬†and offering creative spaces for diverse voices within√Ç¬†marginalized communities. Remembering zines like &#34;FIRE!!,&#34;¬†created in 1926¬†and devoted to the young negro artist, author Steven G. Fullwood will join in conversation√Ç¬†with contemporary zine creators Devin N. Morris (3 Dot¬†Zine), Nontsikelelo Mutiti (Nontsi), Kevin Harry (KHzines),¬†and Jermel Moody (maple:koyo) to elaborate on their zine-making practices and impact on publishing and creativity. The√Ç¬†program will also feature a marketplace of zines selected in√Ç¬†collaboration with Morris, Moody, and the Schomburg Shop.

FIRE!! contributors included Harlem Renaissance figures Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Aaron Douglas.

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">Jeff Bezos&#39;s latest letter to shareholders zeroes in on what makes Amazon successful. In it, he describes how Amazon perpetually exists in &#34;Day 1&#34; As he explains it:
I&#39;ve been reminding people that it&#39;s Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic.
Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.
Bezos defines Day 1 as being customer-focused, as embracing high-velocity decision-making, as sometimes disagreeing yet committing to action.
Join Alpha for a lively panel discussion on what it means to be a Day 1 company. What are the benefits? What are the consequences? How can Day 2 product teams shift to Day 1? Should they?

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">Jeff Bezos&#39;s latest letter to shareholders zeroes in on what makes Amazon successful. In it, he describes how Amazon perpetually exists in &#34;Day 1&#34; As he explains it:
I&#39;ve been reminding people that it&#39;s Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic.
Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.
Bezos defines Day 1 as being customer-focused, as embracing high-velocity decision-making, as sometimes disagreeing yet committing to action.
Join Alpha for a lively panel discussion on what it means to be a Day 1 company. What are the benefits? What are the consequences? How can Day 2 product teams shift to Day 1? Should they?

          <p class="overflow-ellipsis">The use of permissioned blockchains in the public sector has the potential to create a new balance point between two extremes: pure algorithmic governance (e.g., Bitcoin) and pure human governance (e.g., your local city council). This talk will explore if and how blockchain can help bring automation, transparency, and audit-ability to the world‚Äôs governing systems and institutions. Does the strategic introduction of blockchain-enabled validation mechanisms and smart contracts offer a means for rescuing public confidence in governing institutions while cutting costs and better ensuring fair outcomes per policy? Behlendorf will discuss these and other questions related to blockchain‚Äôs coming impact on how we govern.

          <p>The urban mix has become mixed-up as retailers fear extinction at the hands of Amazon, hotels are being redesigned to feel like living rooms ‚Äî or are living rooms courtesy of AirBnB ‚Äî while knowledge workers are setting up shop in coworking spaces, restaurants and public places ‚Äî anywhere but the office. What does it mean for cities when old paradigms such as the office tower, department store, factory, and park fall by the wayside or blur together? What are the opportunities and challenges when pop-ups proliferate because no one can meet the landlords‚Äô asking price? When cafes prove more appealing than cubicles, and parks are more than the sum of their playgrounds?
Moderated by Greg Lindsay, writer, futurist and Urbanist-in-Residence at URBAN-X.
Featured panelists:¬†
Eric Ho, CEO of Good Goods
Preston Pesek, CEO of Spacious

This event is located at Good Goods&#39; store in SOHO. We will &#34;open doors&#34; at 6:30PM and the discussion will start at 6:50PM. Drinks and appetizers will be served.¬†

Come join the conversation this week with¬†Franklin Foer and Zephyr Teachout about Foer&#39;s new book, World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech.

In the early days of the Internet&#39;s rise, many of us believed that it would inevitably democratize power. And indeed, if you were an early adopter, you often gained an outsized advantage. Outsiders and insurgents frequently displaced insiders and incumbents. But now a new kind of power is rapidly concentrating: the power to determine how we connect with each other, how we communicate, and on whose terms.¬†
If there is a silver lining, it is that a wide range of voices are rising to ask hard questions about the power of tech. Here at¬†Civic Hall, we believe that people using technology can work to make the world more just, democratic and equitable.¬†With that mission in mind, we&#39;re kicking off an ongoing series of talks on the topic of Tech and Power.
Copies of¬†World Without Mind: The Existential Threat of Big Tech¬†will be available for purchase!

Register for¬†all three to receive a discount!¬†

          <p>Bloomberg, Cornell Tech, and Tech:NYC invite you to join us for the latest installment of the CornellTech@Bloomberg series, featuring Miguel McKelvey, Co-founder and Chief Culture Officer of WeWork.The recent rise of shared workspaces represents a new paradigm in the workplace and the future of work, which favors flexibility, connectivity and collaboration among budding entrepreneurs and multinational corporations alike. An early trailblazer of this global trend, WeWork and its Co-founder and Chief Culture Officer Miguel McKelvey are shaping this shift in the way we work and, ultimately, live. As demand for shared workspaces continues to flourish, WeWork, already one of the world‚Äôs most valuable unicorn startups, continues to grow and expand at an astounding rate.Yet, while the world we live in is becoming increasingly connected through technological advances and collaborative work environments, McKelvey believes people have never been more disconnected. As a result, McKelvey has recently taken on the role of Chief Culture Officer at WeWork, where he has shifted his focus from the architecture and design of the company‚Äôs spaces to strengthening and scaling the company‚Äôs organizational culture in the face of rapid growth and global expansion. For many rapidly growing organizations, such as WeWork, the challenge is how to grow and scale at a rapid rate, while also maintaining the culture, community, and principles on which the company was founded ‚Äì and for which its members and employees seek it out.McKelvey will be joined onstage by Bloomberg‚Äôs own Scarlet Fu to discuss his new role as WeWork‚Äôs Chief Culture Officer, WeWork‚Äôs plans for the future, as well as his entrepreneurial journey.Bloomberg L.P.

          <p>Shoals Marine Laboratory, located 6 miles offshore in the Gulf of Maine, provides a unique learning environment where students can immerse themselves in an island classroom. More than 50 years ago, the first cohort of Cornell students went out to Appledore Island and the Shoals Marine Lab to study Field Marine Biology. Today, students participate in a wide variety of courses designed to develop the skills and tools needed to address the emerging marine conservation and sustainability challenges of our time.
A fall 2017 exhibit in the Mann Gallery offers a multi-media introduction to life on this remote island field station. Featured are some of the¬†many field-based research opportunities that are available at Shoals--from marine biology and sustainable engineering to archaeology. Come explore!

Cities today are built for the car. Even though there are, in most cases, more pedestrians on urban streets, cars have been allocated a majority of space. While most cities have started to at least partially reverse that hierarchy with the creation of bike lanes and shared streets, we are a long way away from a pedestrians and cyclists first approach to planning. The introduction to CAVs is an opportunity to radically change the way we think of and plan the urban environment, if governments are prepared to regulate the deployment of CAVs in an efficient and sustainable way and planners and urban designers are willing to contribute their part to create streets and public spaces that are for all. This moderated panel ‚Äì made up of an autonomous technology expert, a policy maker, a researcher, and an urban planner ‚Äì will discuss how cities will be impacted and the role of architects and designers during this technology evolution.
Join us for an engaging debate with industry experts.

          <p>‚ÄúIn Cryptography We Trust,‚Äù the unofficial Bitcoin motto, has stimulated the creation of tens of billions of dollars worth of cryptocurrency. What Bitcoin has done for currency, blockchains promise to do for whole industries.
 ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†This workshop will explore the blockchain vision of supplanting human trust with distributed algorithms. Participants representing a broad cross-section of disciplines (e.g., computer scientists, economists, lawyers, legal scholars, entrepreneurs, and regulators) will discuss the technical, social, and legal aspects of reengineering services and whole institutions around blockchains, cryptocurrencies, and smart contracts. Presentations will cover challenges ranging from crime to overhyped technologies, and solutions ranging from deployed systems to mere gleams in the eyes of academic researchers.
The workshop is co-organized by IC3 (www.initc3.org)

          <p>For fifty years, iconic photographer Eugene Richards has traveled the world making seminal records of racism, poverty, drug addiction, cancer, aging, war, and the erosion of rural America, among others. For twenty years, writer Sam Stephenson (of Jazz Loft Project acclaim) followed the global footsteps of Richards&#39; forebear, W. Eugene Smith, the legendary &#34;Master of the Photographic Essay.&#34; 2017 brings landmark books by these two documentary artists.√Ç¬† For Richards, his first career retrospective, the powerful The Run-On of Time; for Stephenson, Gene Smith&#39;s Sink, a stunning, spare narrative from Smith&#39;s trail. In this unique conversation moderated by Arezoo Moseni, Eugene Richards and Sam Stephenson explore the tensions and overlaps of art and journalism, and the relevance and necessity of both to our time more than ever.

In an interview with Philippe Halsman, W. Eugene Smith remarked: &#34;I didn&#39;t write the rule - why should I follow them?&#34; Famously unabashed, Smith is photography&#39;s most celebrated humanist. During his reign as a photo-essayist at Life magazine in the 1940s and 1950s, he established himself as an intimate chronicler of human culture. His photographs of jazz musicians, disasters, doctors, and midwives revolutionized the role that image-making played in journalism, transforming photography for decades to come. In 1997, lured by the intoxicating trail of people that emerged from Smith&#39;s stupefying archive, Sam Stephenson set out to research those who knew him from various angles. In Gene Smith&#39;s Sink: A Wide-Angle View, Stephenson revives Smith&#39;s life and legacy, merging traditional biography with highly untraditional digressions. Traveling across twenty-nine states, Japan, and the Pacific, Stephenson tracks down a lively cast of characters, including the playwright Tennessee Williams, to whom Smith likened himself; the avant-garde filmmaker Stan Brakhage, with whom he once shared a chalet; the artist Mary Frank, who was married to his friend Robert Frank; and Thelonious Monk and Sonny Clark, whom Smith recorded on surreptitious tapes. The result of twenty years of research, Gene Smith&#39;s Sink is an unprecedented look into the photographer&#39;s beguiling legacy and the subjects around him.

The Run-On of Time is the first publication to situate the work of Eugene Richards in the long photographic tradition that merges personal artistic vision with documentary practice. Richards is a documentary photographer known for his powerful, unflinching exploration of contemporary social issues from the early 1970s to the present. This remarkable book is the first comprehensive and critical look at Richards&#39;s lifelong achievements. The Run-On of Time is published in conjunction with Eugene Richards retrospective exhibition of the same title on view at¬†George Eastman Museum in Rochester from June 10 - October 22, 2017 and at¬†The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City from December 9, 2017 - April 15, 2018. Reproduced in tritone and color, the extraordinary images in this volume explore complicated and controversial subjects, including racism, poverty, drug addiction, cancer, aging, the effects of war and terrorism, and the erosion of rural America. The authors of the book,√Ç¬†Lisa Hostetler (photography curator at George Eastman Museum) and√Ç¬† April M. Watson (photography curator at The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art) situate Richards&#39;s work in the long photographic tradition that merges personal artistic vision with documentary practice, following in the tradition of W. Eugene Smith and Robert Frank.

Copies of Gene Smith&#39;s Sink√Ç¬†(Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 2017) and The Run-On of Time (Yale University Press, 2017) are available for purchase and signing at the end of the event.

Eugene Richards, photographer, writer, and filmmaker, was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1944. After graduating from Northeastern University with a degree in English, he studied photography with Minor White. In 1968, he joined VISTA, Volunteers in Service to America, a government program established as an arm of the so-called War on Poverty.¬† Following a year and a half in eastern Arkansas, Richards helped found a social service organization and a community newspaper, Many Voices, which reported on black political action as well as the Ku Klux Klan.¬† Photographs he made during these four years were published in his first monograph, Few Comforts or Surprises: The Arkansas Delta. Upon returning to Dorchester, Richards began to document the changing, racially diverse neighborhood where he was born.¬† After being invited to join Magnum Photos in 1978, he worked increasingly as a freelance magazine photographer, undertaking assignments on such diverse topics as the American family, drug addiction, emergency medicine, pediatric AIDS, aging and death in America.√Ç¬† In 1992, he directed and shot Cocaine True, Cocaine Blue, the first of seven short films he would eventually make.

          <p>In honor of legendary DJ Larry Levan, guests at our fourth annual House Music Edition of¬†First Fridays¬†will jam all night long to house music! Levan was a pioneer of the genre in New York City, best known for his decade-long residency at the popular New York City nightclub¬†Paradise Garage. Levan&#39;s cult followers refer to his hours-long sets as &#34;Saturday Mass&#34;, as he experimented with drum machines√Ç¬†and√Ç¬†synthesizers, popularizing an electronic, post-disco sound that launched the house music movement.

Guests are encouraged to sign up for a¬†Schomburg Society membership, and visit the Schomburg Shop while networking and dancing the night away! Our host for the night will be Dhalimu from Dhali&#39;s Closet, who&#39;ll entertain the crowd as our deejays¬†DJ Missy B, Craig Nice, and DJ Frankie Paradise¬†will have you moving your feet¬†in the Langston Hughes Lobby.

          <p>This illustrated lecture¬†provides a wide-ranging look at the connections inside the core group of avant-garde artists in Jazz Age Paris. It offers a fresh examination of both canonic and overlooked writers and artists and their works, by revealing them in conversation with one another. The author&#39;s celebration of the many masterpieces shows how the creative community of postwar Paris supported astounding experiments in content and form that still resonate today.

          <p>The resurgence of zines - self-published limited-distribution¬†works - is stemming the tide of erasure, disrupting publishing,√Ç¬†and offering creative spaces for diverse voices within√Ç¬†marginalized communities. Remembering zines like &#34;FIRE!!,&#34;¬†created in 1926¬†and devoted to the young negro artist, author Steven G. Fullwood will join in conversation√Ç¬†with contemporary zine creators Devin N. Morris (3 Dot¬†Zine), Nontsikelelo Mutiti (Nontsi), Kevin Harry (KHzines),¬†and Jermel Moody (maple:koyo) to elaborate on their zine-making practices and impact on publishing and creativity. The√Ç¬†program will also feature a marketplace of zines selected in√Ç¬†collaboration with Morris, Moody, and the Schomburg Shop.

FIRE!! contributors included Harlem Renaissance figures Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston and Aaron Douglas.

          <p>Jeff Bezos&#39;s latest letter to shareholders zeroes in on what makes Amazon successful. In it, he describes how Amazon perpetually exists in &#34;Day 1&#34; As he explains it:
I&#39;ve been reminding people that it&#39;s Day 1 for a couple of decades. I work in an Amazon building named Day 1, and when I moved buildings, I took the name with me. I spend time thinking about this topic.
Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.
Bezos defines Day 1 as being customer-focused, as embracing high-velocity decision-making, as sometimes disagreeing yet committing to action.
Join Alpha for a lively panel discussion on what it means to be a Day 1 company. What are the benefits? What are the consequences? How can Day 2 product teams shift to Day 1? Should they?

          <p>The use of permissioned blockchains in the public sector has the potential to create a new balance point between two extremes: pure algorithmic governance (e.g., Bitcoin) and pure human governance (e.g., your local city council). This talk will explore if and how blockchain can help bring automation, transparency, and audit-ability to the world‚Äôs governing systems and institutions. Does the strategic introduction of blockchain-enabled validation mechanisms and smart contracts offer a means for rescuing public confidence in governing institutions while cutting costs and better ensuring fair outcomes per policy? Behlendorf will discuss these and other questions related to blockchain‚Äôs coming impact on how we govern.
